							<h2>Personal Information</h2>
							<p>Jake Pandos s3719022</p>
							<p>My name is Jake Pandos, i am currently 18 years old and studying a bachelor of information technology at RMIT. I Graduated Secondary school at Taylors Lakes Secondary college in the Western Suburbs. I was born and raised in Melbourne as were my parents, i have a background of macedonian as most of my family fled and migrated from their to Melbourne during times of war. My hobbies include keeping fit and attending the gym when i can. I'm a crazy AFL lover and grew up watching Hawthorn and attend all the games i can. The interest i have for IT starts from a young age with ever developing technology and being fascinated from what has been accomplished. This led me to pursue and hopefully be astonished of what i can create or change one day. Other than Year 12 VCE and some programming at home i have little experience in the field.</p>
							
							<p>Angus Puno S3728913</p>
							<p>My name is Angus Puno, I am 18 years old, I was born and raised in Melbourne Australia with both of my parents being full filipino. A hobby of mine is occasionally play basketball with my mates. What has been my main interest in IT is the varieties of possibilities and revolutions in the industry that shape our modern world. I have always been interested in IT by the capabilities of our advancing technology (VR and AI) and what it can do in the future, I’m motivated to hopefully end up to be a part of that change and create help create a step forward to better our daily lives. I have always been immersed in technology all my life, utilizing a computer whilst growing up has allowed me to gain minor IT experience in operating windows and mac operating systems, I eventually ended up building my own personal computer,and during high-school I had picked up some minor visual basic coding skills.</p>
							
							<p>Minh Hai Doan le (Ty) S37223352</p>
							<p>My name is Minh-Hai Doan-le(Ty) , i am currently 18 years old and studying a bachelor of information technology at RMIT. I Graduated Secondary school at Reservoir High in the northern suburbs. I was born and raised in Melbourne, but my family was originally from Vietnam. They fled their native country due to the Vietnam War and ended up migrating to Australia for a better life. My hobbies include watching anime and going to the gym. I’m also into Overwatch particularly in the esport scene.My interest for IT started when i was young, i would always be so fascinated by game consoles and my home PC. This fascination became a passion when my family bought a wifi plan from optus when i was 11. This allowed me to start watching tech youtubers furthering my interest in IT. This eventually led me pursue a career in IT at RMIT. I had no experience in programing coming into IT.</p>
							
							<p> Jessica Donnelly s3602059</p>
							<p>My name is Jess Donnelly I’m 20 years old and currently studying the Bachelor of technology (computing studies). I went to presentation college Windsor and was previously enrolled in the Bachelor of Information Systems at RMIT. An interesting fact about myself is that I have visited every major city in the United states whilst I lived there as an exchange student at age 15. My interest in IT started when I took year 9 IT classes, we attended an excursion to an event encouraging females to study IT learning about the industry and then lack of females in IT made me decide to pursue it as a future career, I was attracted to the flexibility and range of work as well as the above average salaries. I took a gap year after completing VCE to work as an I.t support officer at a secondary school, this role tasked me with solving both hardware and software issues, troubleshooting technology issues and maintaining the school website. </p>
							
							<p>Anthony Tran  S3606439</p>
							<p>I am half chinese/vietnamese, however I unfortunately am only able to speak english fluently with specks of Vietnamese and Cantonese here and there. Before my life at RMIT studying Business, I was in the field of science. However I found no enjoyment out of studying subjects such as the immunology and chemistry and thus turned my attention to business with a keen interest in the field of IT. As age starts to wear down the body and metabolism starts to slow, I find a greater need to exercise and keep in shape. Thus weekly soccer and gym are how I spend part of my day. As a youth I found myself fiddling with the few nintendo 64 games I was given. This had piqued my interest in IT and how someone managed to create something seemingly out of nothing. This developed into online gaming, and then a passion for eSports which enlightened me on how technology has become integrated into every aspect of our lives. I saw this elective as an opportunity to learn more on a field that I have no knowledge about. </p>
							
							<p>Chunning Cai S373276</p>
							<p>My name is Chunning Cai, but preferred to be called Andy, I am 19 years old, I was born in China migrated to Australia in 2008,became Australian citizen in 2013,However I consider myself more of a Chinese rather than an Australian. I speak 3 languages, my native tongue is Mandarin, I also grew up speaking Putian dialect, and then later I learn English in preparation to move to Australia. I graduated from Hillcrest Christian college, that’s where I first got in touch with IT, Even though I didn’t finish my year 12 with a IT course, I still decided to take IT in first year at RMIT. My Favourite Sport is basketball; I follow NBA since year 7, I am also a diehard fan of Los Angeles Lakers. My best memory in High school are all that time I spend with my mates playing basketball during lunch and snack break. One of the reason why I love Basketball so much in because of the NBA legend Kobe Bryant, his Mamba mentality really driven me in everyday life. One of my favourite quote from him is “Everything negative - pressure, challenges - is all an opportunity for me to rise”</p>
							
							<h2>Career Plans</h2>
							
							<p>Jake's Ideal Job: Cyber Security Manager</p>
							<p>Anthony's Ideal Job: Business systems analyst</p>
							<p>Jessica's Ideal Job: Application support developer</p>
							<p>Angus's Ideal Job: IT manager </p>
							<p>Chunning's Ideal Job: Mobile application developer</p>
							<p>Ty's Ideal Job: Chief Technology Officer </p>
							
							<p>Due to the diverse nature of our group, every member had a different role that they want to specialise in. However, majority are interested in working for a large organisation using their IT expertise. This comes as no surprise due to the fact that a large firm will have more resources at your disposal, allowing you to complete your tasks as efficiently and effectively as possible. The differences in career plans lie in which division they are most interested in working in, as a result of either career interests or skill-set they currently possess. p>
							
							<h2>Due to Anthony’s background in business, it has provided him with the skill-set to work as a business systems analyst, as he has the perspective of both a business analyst as well as a IT analyst. This role would lean more towards the creation of new systems and the implementation of them to meet the desired business goals.</h2>
							<p>Jake’s ideal job would be linked to the security division of an organisation. Due to this, he would be able to work alongside any of the other team members as his job could entitle him to provide cyber security assistance to other divisions of the firm depending on the business’ needs. </p>
							
							<p>Jessica’s role as an application support developer would mean that she would be working at the front-of-house, providing support to customers who have inquiries and issues. Her division would also rotate around this and back-of-house activities such as deployment of new technologies, thus exposing her to other divisions of IT within the organisation.</p>
							
							<p>Angus’ ideal job as a IT manager means that his roles would include establishing and managing the technology in a corporate business. The vagueness of this serves as an advantage as it allows him to gather feedback from other divisions of IT in order to make educated decisions based on the information provided to him. </p>
							
							<p>Chunning’s ideal job is to be a mobile application developer. This means that he will work in a team of various individuals to create an app for prospective clients. He would have to go through the phases of analysis, designing, development and evaluation in order to develop a worthwhile application that is both unique and beneficial to its users. </p>
							
							<p>Ty’s ideal job is to become a chief technology officer (CTO) of a large firm. This is the highest role in the IT chain, meaning that he would have to have a plethora of experience in the other division of IT before working his way up to becoming a CTO. He would largely be in control of what type of technology is being researched, and the time frame for each project. </p>
							
							<p>A majority of our ideal jobs require similar skill-sets such as good communication skills, experience in the leadership roles, planning and time management skills. Most of these are gathered through experience in either work or university group work. Alongside this are various basic IT skills that are needed in our ideal roles. It can be seen that any IT job that is to be undertaken will require mainly the same skill-set, thus we can see that even though our ideal occupations are quite different from each other’s, cross-examination and feedback through group work will allow for a greater efficiency when approaching our new projects in the future. </p>
