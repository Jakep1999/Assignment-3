							<h2> Team Name</h2>

							<h2>Personal Information</h2>
							<p>Jake Pandos s3719022</p>

I Graduated Secondary school at Taylors Lakes Secondary college in the Western Suburbs. I was born and raised in Melbourne as were my parents, i have a background of macedonian as most of my family fled and migrated from their to Melbourne during times of war. My hobbies include keeping fit and attending the gym when i can. I'm a crazy AFL lover and grew up watching Hawthorn and attend all the games i can. The interest i have for IT starts from a young age with ever developing technology and being fascinated from what has been accomplished. This led me to pursue and hopefully be astonished of what i can create or change one day. Other than Year 12 VCE and some programming at home i have little experience in the field.</p>
							
							<p>Angus Puno S3728913</p>
							<p>My name is Angus Puno, I am 18 years old, I was born and raised in Melbourne Australia with both of my parents being full filipino. A hobby of mine is occasionally play basketball with my mates. What has been my main interest in IT is the varieties of possibilities and revolutions in the industry that shape our modern world. I have always been interested in IT by the capabilities of our advancing technology (VR and AI) and what it can do in the future, I’m motivated to hopefully end up to be a part of that change and create help create a step forward to better our daily lives. I have always been immersed in technology all my life, utilizing a computer whilst growing up has allowed me to gain minor IT experience in operating windows and mac operating systems, I eventually ended up building my own personal computer,and during high-school I had picked up some minor visual basic coding skills.</p>
							
							<p>Minh Hai Doan le (Ty) S37223352</p>
							<p>My name is Minh-Hai Doan-le(Ty) , i am currently 18 years old and studying a bachelor of information technology at RMIT. I Graduated Secondary school at Reservoir High in the northern suburbs. I was born and raised in Melbourne, but my family was originally from Vietnam. They fled their native country due to the Vietnam War and ended up migrating to Australia for a better life. My hobbies include watching anime and going to the gym. I’m also into Overwatch particularly in the esport scene.My interest for IT started when i was young, i would always be so fascinated by game consoles and my home PC. This fascination became a passion when my family bought a wifi plan from optus when i was 11. This allowed me to start watching tech youtubers furthering my interest in IT. This eventually led me pursue a career in IT at RMIT. I had no experience in programing coming into IT.</p>
							
							<p> Jessica Donnelly s3602059</p>
							<p>My name is Jess Donnelly I’m 20 years old and currently studying the Bachelor of technology (computing studies). I went to presentation college Windsor and was previously enrolled in the Bachelor of Information Systems at RMIT. An interesting fact about myself is that I have visited every major city in the United states whilst I lived there as an exchange student at age 15. My interest in IT started when I took year 9 IT classes, we attended an excursion to an event encouraging females to study IT learning about the industry and then lack of females in IT made me decide to pursue it as a future career, I was attracted to the flexibility and range of work as well as the above average salaries. I took a gap year after completing VCE to work as an I.t support officer at a secondary school, this role tasked me with solving both hardware and software issues, troubleshooting technology issues and maintaining the school website. </p>
							
							<p>Anthony Tran  S3606439</p>
							<p>I am half chinese/vietnamese, however I unfortunately am only able to speak english fluently with specks of Vietnamese and Cantonese here and there. Before my life at RMIT studying Business, I was in the field of science. However I found no enjoyment out of studying subjects such as the immunology and chemistry and thus turned my attention to business with a keen interest in the field of IT. As age starts to wear down the body and metabolism starts to slow, I find a greater need to exercise and keep in shape. Thus weekly soccer and gym are how I spend part of my day. As a youth I found myself fiddling with the few nintendo 64 games I was given. This had piqued my interest in IT and how someone managed to create something seemingly out of nothing. This developed into online gaming, and then a passion for eSports which enlightened me on how technology has become integrated into every aspect of our lives. I saw this elective as an opportunity to learn more on a field that I have no knowledge about. </p>
							
							<p>Chunning Cai S373276</p>
							<p>My name is Chunning Cai, but preferred to be called Andy, I am 19 years old, I was born in China migrated to Australia in 2008,became Australian citizen in 2013,However I consider myself more of a Chinese rather than an Australian. I speak 3 languages, my native tongue is Mandarin, I also grew up speaking Putian dialect, and then later I learn English in preparation to move to Australia. I graduated from Hillcrest Christian college, that’s where I first got in touch with IT, Even though I didn’t finish my year 12 with a IT course, I still decided to take IT in first year at RMIT. My Favourite Sport is basketball; I follow NBA since year 7, I am also a diehard fan of Los Angeles Lakers. My best memory in High school are all that time I spend with my mates playing basketball during lunch and snack break. One of the reason why I love Basketball so much in because of the NBA legend Kobe Bryant, his Mamba mentality really driven me in everyday life. One of my favourite quote from him is “Everything negative - pressure, challenges - is all an opportunity for me to rise”</p>
							
							<h2>Three Test Outcomes and Comparisons</h2>
							
							<p>Jake Pandos </p>
							<p>Myers briggs- Test 1: The myers briggs test result showed that i have a “Protagonist” personality type. Outcomes to be an extrovert rather in an introvert. In terms of being in a group this means that i will be communicative and outgoing and tend to be social instead of distant and shy. This is really good for a team environment as it helps with bonding and getting to know one another. It is also present that i was more intuitive than observant, to me this tends to be neither bad nor good. I believe that in a team environment both can work. To take charge and always do things has it upsides and downs but observing and listening and taking in everyones opinions is also very important. This is directly linked to my assertive trait as i tend to take charge in most team environments. Every group needs someone who is willing to direct and traffic, i tend to like to be that person. This is very good for a team environment as it gives sense of direction and goals to be achieved by setting tasks for members etc.</p>
							<p>Test 2: For the Learning style test, it was deemed i am an “Auditory” learner. This means that i learn by hearing and listening. I store important information by a certain sound and have an easier time understanding spoken instructions than written ones. In a team environment to me this is very satisfying as i know that i can listen and take everyone's inputs to the assignment. To read out the assignment specifications and discuss with team members allows me to further understand and analyse the task at hand. </p>
							<p>Test 3: The big five personality test was the last personal test i completed, once again highlighting that i'm an extrovert but also showed that i'm very relaxed in stressful situations and tend to always think for the better. I am ranked in the middle in how competitive and sceptical i can be with things in life. And highly prefer flexible plans and schedules with a down to earth practical personality. By being less stressed and relaxed in hard situations helps the team with overall morale and mindset. If a member is always stressing out and bickering, this could lead to arguments and misconceptions. With correct planning and a clear mind sets. A team working environment will excel.</p>
							
							<p>Angus Puno</p>
							<p>Myers briggs- Test 1: The meaning of the title “Entertainer” to me is that it highlights my positive characteristics. To me , an “entertainer” is essential to a team as a immensely positive member that can significantly grow a team closer. I can see  these results reflecting myself not only as a dependable team-member but also a confident person that can easily grow friendships and vibe well with others which is vital for cooperation within businesses and project teams to motivate teamwork.</p>
							<p>Online learning style Test 2: The results of the Learning Style Test concluded that I was a “tactile learner”. This exhibits my best approach to acquiring new skills, the more physical work and repetition I put in, the better my results and performance will increase. In a team environment, it applies the same way. With a team, I can better perform with the more tasks I complete, as I usually find myself getting used to the pace and workload of tasks with the benefits of team members.</p>
							<p>Test 3: I completed the big five personality test which indicates my high emotional stability, which is necessary for team tasks and emitting a positive aura and motivation to others. It also complimented my extroversion attribute which indicates my way of thinking to benefit someone other than myself, which is vital for group tasks as it defines me understanding others from their perspective. The test also highlighted my agreeableness, as I can easily comprehend and perceive others views and take that into consideration.</p>
							
							<p>Ty Doan </p>
							<p>Myers briggs- Test 1: The myers briggs test revealed a “Protagonist”, this making me an extrovert meaning that i am more outgoing than reserved. This would be beneficial in a team environment as i would naturally assume the leader position due having good interpersonal skills and a clear vision of what i expect. I find that the mood i radiate affects my teammates therefore i try to always be put together and level headed. As the leader most of the responsibilities of working in a group fall to you, it is important to listen to teammates as their opinion is incredibly important. This allows me to delegate tasks to teammates efficiently. I also realise that due to my outgoing personality that i have become the nucleus of the group, i connect teammates together and without me, communication would cut into a fraction.</p>
							<p>Online learning style Test 2: The online learning style concluded that i was a “tactile learner”. This means that my best method of learning is through hands on repetition. The more time and effort i put into the task, the better and faster i will improve on it. In a team environment it usually takes me some time to warm up before i can pick up the pace. This is beneficial as it gives time for teammates to ease themselves into their own task and provides opportunity to collaborate.</p>
							<p>Test 3: I decided to complete the big five personality test giving me the result of high emotional stability. This is beneficial in a team environment as i can bear the emotional strain that this environment would put on me. It allows me to stay calm and collected so i can lead the team with a clear mindset, preventing another teammate from tilting. </p>
							
							<p>Jessica Donnelly </p>
							<p>Myers briggs- Test 1: For my myer briggs test results I was deemed the Mediator (INFP-T) personality type. This personality type means I am Introverted, I prefer to be with a smaller group of friends rather than a larger group. Intuition, following a gut feeling despite concrete facts. Value personal feelings above logic when making decisions, withhold judgement and delay decisions. I can see all of these qualities in myself, Mediators are the personality type most likely to be vegetarian or vegan which is very accurate, some famous mediators are William Shakespeare and J.R.R Tolkien.</p>
							<p>Online learning style Test 2: My scores for the online learning test were 15% Auditory, 55% Visual and 30% tactile. This means that I learn best when using images and colours. I prefer to map things out on paper and am good at visualizing ideas. I also scored highly in tactile learning meaning I am good at hands on learning that involve physical activity. My lowest score was in Auditory which refers to learning through listening to lectures and classes.</p>
							<p>Another you chose Test 3: I completed the big five personality test, my score were as follows; openness 71%, conscientiousness 21%, extraversion 17%, agreeableness 71% and neuroticism 56%. My dominant traits are openness and agreeableness, this means that I am creative, open to trying to new things, empathetic, and enjoy helping others. My weakest traits are conscientiousness and extraversion meaning I prefer solitude, dislike being the centre of attention, procrastinate and am a messy person. </p>
							
							<p>Anthony Tran </p>
							<p>Myers briggs- Test 1: My result for the Myer-Briggs test was an Entrepreneur (ESTP-A). This meant that I am extroverted, meaning I prefer to be more sociable as opposed to withdrawn. I tend to prefer a more concrete information to base my judgements off, which means I am more rational in my thoughts as opposed to listening to my feelings. I am more ‘perceiving’ than ‘judging’ meaning I am less likely to plan things and more likely to improvise on ideas. I believe this can help in a group environment where I can provide a different perspective to the team.</p>
							<p>Online learning style Test 2: I am 25% auditory, 40% visual and 35% tactile. This means I'm more likely to learn better through visual cues as opposed to retaining information through spoken communication. I also scored just as highly in the ‘tactile’ area which meant that I learn faster by doing things by hand. The greater amount of effort and repetition that is allocated, the faster I will improve.</p>
							<p>Another you chose Test 3: Big Five Personality Test results: I scored 50% for extroversion, 89% for emotional stability, 67% for agreeableness, 31% for conscientiousness and 23% for Intellect/Imagination.These results show that I have the capability to be extroverted, but enjoy my alone time. I'm considerate when it comes to others feelings, which means that I'm able to form groups more easily as I can easily adapt to the environment I'm placed in. Thus I think that as a part of the team, I will be able to contribute more as a mediator between teammates as well as my primary role of helping in the assignment.</p>
							
							<p>Chunning Cai aka Andy</p>
							<p>Myers briggs- Test 1: My Myers briggs test result shows that I have a Mediator personality type. People with Mediator personality type have great inner passion that can truly shine, however they are introverted. When facing problems, we Mediator tends to solve the problem under the guidance of our heart, rather than by logic and practicality. Mediators are more active in small groups (with just few people) than bigger teams,this is because they are shy and reserved, however, they are great listeners, often drift others words into deep thought. When comes to forming a group, as a Mediator, I feel freer to contribute ideas in discussions and will put efforts in group works, on the other hand mediator hate to start to involve in conflicts with other group member , they will do everything to maintain a harmony group atmosphere.</p>
							<p>Online learning style Test 2: My Learning Style scare were 40% auditory, 40% tactile and 20% visual.which according to the results I am both auditory and tactile learning. Part of been an auditory learner, I learn better by hearing and listening, In completing group assignments, I can understand better when team leader is giving out instruction verbally than in a written format. On the other hand as a tactile learner, I learn by touching and doing, I remember things through physical movement, while working on group tasks, i am more efficient when I am fiddling a pen or shaking my foot.</p>
							<p>Another you chose Test 3: My creativity score is 68.04, where the typical score for others is 63.45, this means that I am slightly more creative than an average person. The results demonstrates that I have strength in creativing connection between things that have no apparent connections, and have the desire to improve or change things that everyone else think is normal. The result also shows that I am confident to push boundaries beyond limits and eliminate fear of what others think of me. </p>
